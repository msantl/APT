<s> metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine </s> 
<s> asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later </s> 
<s> in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice </s> 
<s> a u. s. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was months and of formal asd diagnosis was months reflecting an average delay all far above recommendations </s> 
<s> although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits </s> 
<s> underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices </s> 
<s> the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms </s> 
<s> conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis </s> 
<s> it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes </s> 
<s> management </s> 
<s> the main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence </s> 
<s> no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child needs </s> 
<s> studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy </s> 
<s> although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options </s> 
<s> intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated </s>

<s> educational interventions have some effectiveness in children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children </s> 
<s> neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided </s> 
<s> it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results </s> 
<s> many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails </s> 
<s> more than half of u. s. children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics </s> 
<s> aside from antipsychotics there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd </s> 
<s> a person with asd may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects and no known medication relieves autism core symptoms of social and communication impairments </s> 
<s> although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies </s>

<s> the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early </s> 
<s> this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified contributing environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out </s>

<s> the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia </s> 
<s> he derived it from the greek word autos meaning self and used it to mean morbid self-admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance </s> 
<s> the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology </s> 
<s> asperger was investigating a form of asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a report of children with striking behavioral similarities </s> 
<s> almost all the characteristics described in kanner first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders </s> 
<s> it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger </s> 
<s> kanner reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant response to refrigerator mothers </s> 
<s> starting in the late autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy </s> 
<s> as late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions </s> 
<s> although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children behaviors are perceived negatively by others and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research </s> 
<s> the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely </s>

<s> albedo </s> 
<s> the albedo of an object is the extent to which it diffusely reflects light from the sun </s> 
<s> it is therefore a more specific form of the term reflectivity </s> 
<s> albedo is defined as the ratio of diffusely reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation </s> 
<s> it is a unitless measure indicative of a surface or body diffuse reflectivity </s> 
<s> the word is derived from latin albedo whiteness in turn from albus white </s> 
<s> the range of possible values is from dark to bright </s> 
<s> the albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy </s> 
<s> in climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage </s> 
<s> its value depends on the frequency of radiation considered unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light </s> 
<s> in general the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation </s> 
<s> exceptions are lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions in a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution </s> 
<s> in realistic cases a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf is required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately although albedos are a very useful first approximation </s> 
<s> terrestrial albedo </s> 
<s> albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances </s>

<s> the average albedo of the earth is about </s> 
<s> this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds </s> 
<s> human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe </s> 
<s> however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult </s> 
<s> the classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback </s> 
<s> if a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase </s>
