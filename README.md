Predictive Typing system
---

The aim of this project is to build a predictive typing system for an arbitrary
language.
The system should rely on the language model that is built from a large corpus
given as
input. The underlying language model should incorporate some of the advanced
smoothing
methods such as Witten-Bell or Kneser-Ney methods. The implemented language
models
with dierent smoothing techniques should be evaluated using measures of
perplexity and
cross-entropy on the separate test fraction of the corpus. Finally, a text
editor with the
predictive typing capabilities should be developed.
